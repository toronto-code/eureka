# Mycelium

A company-wide agentic intelligence layer that observes how a software company works, builds a living knowledge graph, and deploys agents that can act on that knowledge autonomously or on demand.

> Status: scaffolding. Goal is structure + wiring, not business logic.
> Target scale: ~10 developers. Simple > clever.

## Quick start

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up --build
```

This starts everything except the `services/observer` (which runs locally on developer machines — see `services/observer/README.md`).

After the stack is up:

- API: http://localhost:8000 (docs at `/docs`)
- Frontend: http://localhost:5173
- Postgres: localhost:5432
- Neo4j browser: http://localhost:7474
- Redis: localhost:6379

A seed script populates fake events, a fake company graph, fake `integration_syncs` rows, and fake agent activity so the UI is non-empty on first run.

## Testing

```bash
make test
```

Runs `scripts/ci/run-tests.sh`: **Python tests** inside `python:3.11-slim` (asyncpg/pgvector-compatible) and **frontend tests** (`vitest`) in `node:20-bookworm-slim`. Requires Docker. With **Poetry** on the host, you can alternatively run each package under `pytest` individually if your interpreter is Python 3.11+.

## Implementation rules (read before changing anything)

1. Frontend talks to API. Never to a service. Never to a database.
2. Services may HTTP-call each other for queries. Never read each other's databases.
3. Events flow: producer → `events.raw` → `security/classification` → `events.processed` → consumers.
4. Redis is **transport**. Postgres is the **system of record**.
5. `services/knowledge` is the sole owner of Neo4j.
6. `services/integrations` is the sole writer of `integration_syncs`.
7. The API ingestion worker is the sole writer of the `events` table.
8. `correlation_id` is mandatory. `parent_correlation_id` is set for any event that modifies/extends a prior event.
9. `schema_version` is mandatory. Default `"1.0"`. Bump on field changes. Document in `docs/contracts.md`.
10. Event ordering is per `correlation_id` partition only. Never global.
11. AgentTask lifecycle is strict: `queued → running → succeeded | failed → retried → succeeded | cancelled`. No skipping.
12. Observer captures only: command name (no args), repo path, timestamp, changed filenames (no contents).
13. `DEV_MODE=true` is the default. Every service logs `Running in DEV_MODE — auth disabled` at startup.
14. Stub, don't skip. Return realistic fake data for unbuilt dependencies.

See `docs/contracts.md` for the full contract.
